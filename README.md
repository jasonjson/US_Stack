Stack Rayleigh phase velocity for U.S.

treat 20 30s differently with the rest of period bands: scale bar

tecton_bound.gmt contains geological boundaries

nam_labels.dat contains geological location names

all_Period_* contains velocity results for all stations and all seismic events

dyna_stru_ave_* contains average dynamic and structural phase velocity results

plot_*.sh are plotting scripts for each period

vel_stack.py is the script to extract average velocity resultsf from all_Period_*
